# About cowin-pincode-availability
Hi, this simple script is based on the integration of cowin APIs. It takes your age, pincode and number of days you need data for as parameter and fetch you the result for the same. 
There are other APIs as well, you can find them here : https://apisetu.gov.in/public/api/cowin

You are free to use, modify and upscale the script as you like. Do let me know if I can contribute in it too. 
Currently the API limit is 500 calls every 5 minutes in stochastic flow of requests I believe. If needed, I will keep posting updates 

Requirements: 
1. Python 3.5 or higher 
2. requests2.25.1
